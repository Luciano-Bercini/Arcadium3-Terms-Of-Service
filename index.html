    You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
    You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you are not allowed to make derivative versions.
    The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, belong to ihgyug, except for the cases specified in this clause.
    All copyright and other proprietary notices shall be retained on all reproductions.
    <strong>You represent that You are 16 years or older.</strong>
    You represent that you are accessing our Games as a private person (consumer). Service offered by ihgyug are intended solely for the purpose of entertainment. No commercial use of our games is allowed.
    If You do not agree to the Agreement and/or Privacy Policy, you may not use or otherwise access Service. Use of the Services is void where prohibited.
    The Arcadium - Space Odyssey app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide the Service.
    It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.
    We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
    It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Arcadium - Space Odyssey app won’t work properly or at all.
    The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.
    You should be aware that there are certain things that ihgyug will not take responsibility for.
    Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection.
    The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but ihgyug cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
    If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply.
    As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges.
    In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
    If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
    With respect to ihgyug’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.
    ihgyug accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
